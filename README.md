Questions for above solutions : 

1. Archaeological Image Reconstruction Archaeologists often discover ancient artifacts with damaged or 
partially obscured inscriptions or paintings. By employing GANs, how can researchers reconstruct and denoise 
these images to reveal hidden details, aiding in the interpretation and preservation of historical artifacts?
2. Astrophotography Enhancement Astrophotographers capture images of celestial objects such as stars, 
galaxies, and nebulae, but these images can be affected by noise from light pollution, atmospheric turbulence, 
and sensor limitations. How can GANs be applied to enhance astrophotography by removing noise and 
enhancing faint details, enabling deeper exploration of the cosmos?
3. Fashion Photography In fashion photography, high-quality images are essential for showcasing clothing 
designs and accessories. However, photoshoots may encounter lighting issues, background distractions, or 
camera sensor noise. How can GANs be utilized to denoise fashion photographs, ensuring that the products 
are presented in their best light and attracting customers?
4. Environmental Monitoring Environmental monitoring stations use cameras to capture images of ecosystems, 
wildlife, and environmental changes. However, these images can be affected by weather conditions, 
vegetation interference, or sensor noise. How can GANs be employed to clean up environmental monitoring 
images, enabling accurate analysis of ecological trends and biodiversity?
5. Cultural Heritage Preservation Cultural heritage sites, such as ancient monuments and landmarks, are often 
captured in photographs for documentation and preservation purposes. However, these images may suffer 
from degradation over time due to factors like weathering, pollution, or aging. How can GANs be leveraged to 
restore and denoise these historical photographs, ensuring that they remain accessible for future generations 
to study and appreciate?
6. Art Restoration Imagine you're working with a museum that wants to restore old, damaged artworks. How 
can GANs be applied to automatically remove noise, scratches, and other imperfections from scanned images 
of these artworks while preserving their original features and artistic style?
7. Satellite Image Enhancement In satellite imagery, noise and atmospheric distortions can degrade the quality 
of images, affecting tasks like land cover classification and environmental monitoring. How can GANs be 
leveraged to enhance the clarity and detail of satellite images, making them suitable for accurate analysis and 
decision-making?
8. Medical Image Denoising Medical images, such as MRI scans and X-rays, are crucial for diagnosis and 
treatment planning. However, these images often suffer from noise, reducing their diagnostic value. How can 
GANs be utilized to denoise medical images effectively while ensuring that important diagnostic information 
is preserved?
9. Automotive Industry In the automotive industry, cameras are used extensively for tasks like autonomous 
driving, driver assistance systems, and vehicle inspection. However, images captured by these cameras can be 
corrupted by environmental factors like rain, fog, or dirt on the lens. How can GANs be employed to clean up 
these noisy images and improve the performance of computer vision algorithms in automotive applications?
10. Security and Surveillance Security cameras are prone to various types of noise, including low light conditions, 
motion blur, and compression artifacts. When analyzing surveillance footage for security purposes, it's crucial 
to have clear, noise-free images for accurate identification and event detection. How can GANs be integrated 
into video processing pipelines to denoise surveillance footage in real-time, enhancing the effectiveness of 
security systems?
